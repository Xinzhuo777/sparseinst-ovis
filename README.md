### Background

This is a group assignment where we try to train the sparseinst model with the OVIS dataset. I used the MinVIS libraries and interfaces to make the OVIS dataset import and training work.I hope that the use of MinVIS-related functions will not affect the implementation of sparseinst.If there is a fundamental error in principle, please inform us promptly on the issue. Thank you.

#### Usage

I use starts.ipynb to run sparseinst-ovis. I did the inference and training on colab. Due to some features of colab, I use a lot of absolute paths in my code to import some functions. You will need to make some modifications to the paths when you run them in other environments.Other code comments I will give those in stars.ipynb where possible. I will also improve some of my code later.
